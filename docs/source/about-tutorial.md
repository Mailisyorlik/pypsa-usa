### Troubleshooting:

To force the execution of a portion of the workflow up to a given rule, cd to the `workflow` directory and run:

```bash
snakemake -j4 -R build_shapes  --until build_base_network
```
where `build_shapes` is forced to run, and `build_base_network`  is the last rule you would like to run.
